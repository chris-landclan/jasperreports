rem This script will need to be run with Administrator privileges if your TIBCO Jaspersoft Studio install location is
rem under Administrator control on your system (which is probably true if you installed it to Program Files).

rem This script takes the backup of the official Jasper Reports jar file that was created when the counterpart batch
rem script 'enable-landclan-version-in-js.bat' was run and re-instates it as the main jar file so that JS runs with the
rem official jar.

rem The install location on my local machine of the relevant jar file is:
rem C:\Program Files\TIBCO\Jaspersoft Studio-6.19.1\configuration\org.eclipse.osgi\64\0\.cp\lib\jasperreports-6.19.1.jar

rem If we do not already have a backup of the official build then it is to be assumed that the counterpart batch script
rem has not been run so there is nothing to do.
